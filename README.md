# Introduction

**HIASCDI** is the **Hospital Intelligent Automation Server Contextual Data Interface**. HIASCDI is an implementation of a [CEF Context Broker (NGSI v2)](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/). A context broker stores contextual data and serves it to applications by exposing the data through a REST API and pushing data through subscriptions.

# HIAS

![HIAS - Hospital Intelligent Automation Server](assets/images/HIAS.jpg)

[HIAS - Hospital Intelligent Automation Server](https://github.com/AIIAL/HIAS-Server) is an open-source automation server designed to control and manage an intelligent network of IoT connected devices and applications.

In addition to real-time and historical data, the HIAS network is powered by contextual data. HIAS users, IoT devices, robotics, AI agents and other HIAS compatible projects each have a JSON representation stored in HIASCDI. These JSON representations are made up of contextual data which represent the current state of the physical/virtual entity.

HIAS devices and applications are the **contextual data producers** for the HIAS network. These devices and applications publish data to the context broker using supported machine to machine communication protocols and the REST API.

HIAS devices and applications are also the **contextual data consumers**. Devices and applications connected to the network consume contextual data generated by the network.

# Connecting Europe Facility

![CEF Context Broker](assets/images/cef-context-broker.jpg)

We are proud to be collaborating with the [Connecting Europe Facility (CEF/CEF Digital)](https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/CEF+Digital+Home) for the HIAS/HIASCDI project. CEF is a European Union initiative facilitating the delivery of digital public services across Europe.

HIASCDI has been developed to be compliant with the [NGSI v2 specification](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/). With the support and guidance of CEF and FIWARE we are working towards interoperability and EU-compliance for HIAS/HIASCDI.
